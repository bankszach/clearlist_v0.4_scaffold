# Editorial Style (Neutral)
- Avoid role‑titles in prose (no guru/saint/teacher). Use neutral data fields.
- Keep 3–5 sourced **claims** max; each has `evidence` ids.
- **Practice** notes are modest and safety‑first; no extremes.
- Record provenance with reliability scores (0–1). Prefer primary sources.
- Use ISO dates (YYYY‑MM‑DD). UTF‑8 text. No HTML in fields.
