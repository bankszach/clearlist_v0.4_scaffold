# CLEARLIST AI Wisdom Agents

**Transform structured spiritual wisdom into interactive AI experiences.**

This system brings the CLEARLIST profiles to life as AI agents that embody each teacher's authentic voice and wisdom. By loading profile JSON files and using them as rich context for OpenAI API calls, each agent responds in the distinctive style and approach of their respective spiritual tradition.

## Features

- **üé≠ Authentic Personas**: AI agents that embody each teacher's unique voice, methods, and insights
- **üìö Rich Context**: Comprehensive use of profile data including teachings, practices, claims, and traditions
- **üí¨ Interactive Wisdom**: Full conversation mode for deep exploration of spiritual concepts
- **üîç Cross-Tradition Exploration**: Compare approaches across Advaita, VedƒÅnta, and Bhakti traditions
- **‚ö° Ready to Use**: Complete Python system with OpenAI integration and beautiful CLI interface
- **üå± Extensible**: Easy to add new profiles and customize agent behavior

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Copy the environment template and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

### 3. Verify Profile Data

Ensure your `profiles/` directory contains the profile JSON files. The system will automatically load:
- `ramana-maharshi.json`
- `nisargadatta-maharaj.json` 
- `anandamayi-ma.json`

## Usage

### Interactive Chat Mode

Start an interactive chat with a profile agent:

```bash
# Chat with a specific profile
python profile_agent.py --profile ramana-maharshi

# Or let the system prompt you to choose
python profile_agent.py
```

### List Available Profiles

```bash
python profile_agent.py --list
```

### Single Question Mode

```bash
python profile_agent.py --no-interactive --profile nisargadatta-maharaj
```

### Demo Script

Run the included demo script to see the system in action:

```bash
python demo.py
```

## üåü Project Significance

This system represents a breakthrough in how structured spiritual data can be used to create meaningful AI experiences. By combining:

- **Structured Wisdom**: CLEARLIST's carefully curated profiles of spiritual teachers
- **AI Technology**: OpenAI's language models for natural conversation
- **Authentic Context**: Rich metadata including teachings, practices, and traditions

We've created something unique: AI agents that don't just simulate spiritual teachers, but truly embody their documented wisdom and approach.

## How It Works

### 1. Profile Loading
The `ProfileManager` class scans the `profiles/` directory and loads all JSON files, parsing them into structured data.

### 2. Persona Construction
Each `ProfileAgent` builds a comprehensive system prompt that includes:
- Core teachings and thesis
- Traditional affiliations
- Key claims and principles
- Practice methods and steps
- Important care notes
- Behavioral instructions

### 3. AI Response Generation
The agent uses the OpenAI API to generate responses that:
- Stay true to the teacher's voice and style
- Draw from their specific teachings and methods
- Avoid anachronistic language
- Maintain authenticity to their tradition

### 4. Rich Interaction
The system provides:
- Beautiful terminal formatting with Rich
- Interactive prompts and selections
- Error handling and graceful fallbacks
- Rate limiting considerations

## Example Conversation

Here's what a conversation with Ramana Maharshi might look like:

```
You: What is self-inquiry?

Ramana Maharshi: Self-inquiry is the direct path to Self-realization. 
When you ask "Who am I?" and turn your attention inward, you begin 
to see that the 'I' thought is not the true Self. The true Self is 
that which remains when all thoughts, including the 'I' thought, 
are set aside. It is the silent witness, the pure awareness that 
underlies all experience.

The practice is simple: whenever you become aware of thoughts, 
gently ask "To whom do these thoughts arise?" The answer will 
be "To me." Then ask "Who am I?" and turn your attention to 
the source of that 'I' feeling. Rest there, in that sense of 
being, without trying to grasp or understand it.
```

## Profile Data Structure

The system works with the CLEARLIST profile schema, which includes:

- **Basic Info**: Name, pronunciation, life dates
- **Affiliations**: Traditions, schools, orders
- **Core Content**: Thesis, keywords, claims
- **Practices**: Named practices with step-by-step instructions
- **AI Context**: Q&A pairs and synopsis for AI use
- **Metadata**: Sources, licensing, provenance

## Customization

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_MODEL`: Choose your preferred OpenAI model
- `MAX_TOKENS`: Control response length
- `TEMPERATURE`: Adjust response creativity
- `DEFAULT_PROFILE`: Set a default profile for quick access

### Adding New Profiles

Simply add new JSON files to the `profiles/` directory following the CLEARLIST schema. The system will automatically detect and load them.

### Modifying Agent Behavior

Edit the `_build_system_prompt()` method in `ProfileAgent` to customize how personas are constructed and how they should behave.

## Technical Details

- **Async Support**: Full async/await support for efficient API calls
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures and missing data
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotations for better development experience
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns between profile management and AI interaction

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Found**: Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. **No Profiles Loaded**: Check that the `profiles/` directory exists and contains valid JSON files
3. **API Rate Limits**: The system includes small delays between requests to avoid rate limiting

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can modify the logging in the `ProfileManager._load_profiles()` method to see exactly what's happening during profile loading.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Profile search and filtering
- Conversation history and memory
- Multi-profile conversations
- Export conversations to various formats
- Integration with other AI providers
- Web interface for easier access

## License

This AI Wisdom Agents system follows the same license as the CLEARLIST project (CC BY-SA 4.0).
